git switch : changes the branch.

git stash : holds uncommittet changes.

git checkout <commit hash> : goes back to the commit but we need to create a new branch here.

git reset <commit hash>:The git reset command is used to undo the changes in your working directory and get back to a specific commit while discarding all the commits made after that one. 

git reset --hard : delete old commits.

git revert <commit hash to revert>: git revert inverts the changes introduced by the original commit by creating a new commit with the underlying inverse content.  

We can configure an individual repo to use a specific user / email address 
which overrides the global configuration. From the root of the repo, run

    git config user.name "Your Name Here"
    git config user.email your@email.com

whereas the default user / email is configured in our ~/.gitconfig

    git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
    git config --global user.email your@email.com
