Awk is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports. 
The awk command programming language requires no compiling and allows the user to use variables,
 numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators. 

Awk is a utility that enables a programmer to write tiny but effective programs in the form of statements
that define text patterns that are to be searched for in each line of a document and the action that is
to be taken when a match is found within a line. Awk is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing. 
It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that matches with the specified patterns and 
then perform the associated actions. 

!! **Default behavior of Awk**: By default Awk prints every line of data from the specified file.  

- Print lines by default ----> awk '{print}' employees.txt

- Print lines which match the given pattern ----> awk '/account/ {print}' employees.txt 

- Print lines by splitting into fields ----> awk '{print $1,$3}' employees.txt

- Print line numbers with NR ----> awk '{print NR,$0}' employees.txt 

- Print last field with NF ----> awk '{print $2,$NF}' employee.txt
