jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor akin to sed,awk,grep, and friends for JSON data. 
It's written in portable C and has zero runtime dependencies, allowing you to easily slice, filter, map
and transform structured data.

You can install jq with brew install jq command.

jq is built around the concept of filters that work over a stream of JSON. Each filter takes an 
input and emits JSON to standard out. As weâ€™re going to see, there are many predefined filters 
that we can use. We can effortlessly combine these filters using pipes to quickly construct and 
apply complex operations and transformations to our JSON data.

- Prettify json -----> echo '{"Capitals":{"Turkey":"Ankara","Germany":"Berlin","Austria":"Vienna"}}' | jq '.'

- Prettify json file -----> jq '.' capitals.json

- Access Properties -----> echo '{"Capitals":{"Turkey":"Ankara","Germany":"Berlin","Austria":"Vienna"},
                            "Teams":{"Galatasaray":"Turkey","Bayern Munich":"Germany","Rapid Wien":"Austria"}  }' | jq '.Teams'

- Access value in Properties -----> echo '{"Capitals":{"Turkey":"Ankara","Germany":"Berlin","Austria":"Vienna"},
                            "Teams":{"Galatasaray":"Turkey","Bayern Munich":"Germany","Rapid Wien":"Austria"}  }' | jq '.Teams.Galatasaray'
